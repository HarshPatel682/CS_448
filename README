The format of my output is not exactly the same as the expected output, but its contents are correct, except for the deadlock prevention.
I was unable to get the deadlock detection done but I was fairly close to getting it.

I have code for making a graph and detecting a cycle, however, I was unable to figure some of the logic out.
The way I have it setup is that I create the round robin schedule with all of the transactions and store them into a string.
Then I split up the string and run each part of the transaction according to the schedule. Then I run the system log to document
each operation. I was thinking about checking for cycles while I was making the round robin schedule. Then when I would hit
an abort, I would go though the system log to revert the changes that that specific transaction has made.
Again, I was very close to getting the cycle detection.
